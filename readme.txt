==========README Notes========
I am terrible at programming and I apologize to all the programming deities in the world for having to put up with my unworthiness.

-Things that are missing in this version I hope to add in the future:
	-A map of the U.S. that shows prison population by state
	-More overlays
	-A breakdown of total confined versus maximum capacity of prisons
	-Datasets for 2009, 2011 and 2013 (I found them too late in the process)


Things that need to be fixed in this version:
	-dataTables won't parse. urgh
	-The bxSlider looks kind of scrummy.
	-General code cleaning because hello artifacts up the wazoo
